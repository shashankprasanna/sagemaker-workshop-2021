### You’ll go through the following steps (TBD):
1. Set up Amazon SageMaker Studio to build and train your deep learning models.
2. Download a public dataset using Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebook and upload it to Amazon S3.
3. Create an Amazon SageMaker Experiment to track and manage training jobs
4. Run Amazon SageMaker large-scale training and model tuning:
	a. Using Built-in Algorithms.
	b. Using custom code for training with Tensorflow
5. Improve accuracy by running a large-scale Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning job to find the best model hyperparameters
